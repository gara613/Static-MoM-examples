  %function meshdata=readDatMesh(fname)
  %
  %Read a mesh file as given by the output format .dat of salome
  %The first line specifies the number of vertices and elements
  %followed by rows with 4 elements for vertex index and coordinates, then
  %rows with four elements specifying edges (not used here) and finally rows
  %with five elements, the last three of which give vertex indices
  %
  % Output is a data structure with fields:
  %   verts: Nv x 3 array, each row tells vertex coordinates in meters
  %   cells: Nc x 5 array, each row tells cell type (2 for triangle), index
  %       of the three vertices defining each triangle, and a zero.
