# Static MoM examples
Contains some examples on the solution of basic electrostatic problems using MoM formulation
- Charge distribution on Parallel plates
- Charge distribution on a wire
- Calculation of the capacitance between two arbitrary surfaces (mesh is Generated externaly in a proper CAD software) using the RWG functions

The latter is launched from the MoMCharge script. Requires the routine "readDatMesh" to read Salome generated meshes, not included for ownership reasons.
A compatible function can be written according to the description of input and outputs provided.
